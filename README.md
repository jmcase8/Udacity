## Project 4
During this project tweets were wrangled from the twitter user WeRateDogs. The tweets often contained missing data and came in a variety of formats. The gathered data was assessed for quality and tidiness and then cleaned. After cleaning the data was analyzed and several visualizations were created.

## Project 5 
In this project I created python visualizations for exploratory data analysis on loan data from Prosper. The project begins by looking at univariate plot, then bivariate plots, and finally mulitvariate plots. Finally, explanatory data visualization techniques were utilized to communicate the results of my findings.
